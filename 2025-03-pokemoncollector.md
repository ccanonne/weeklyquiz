🧩 New week, time for our weₐᵉkly quiz! Today, another thing a bit random: Pokémon! Ash and Barry want to catch 'em all: all of them. You know, Pikachu, Jigglypuff, err... Charmander? It's been a while.

So, n Pokémon to catch, and no idea how long it'll take. Gotta help them out! #WeaeklyQuiz

1/

How does it work? Our heroes walk around for a long while until a Pokemon appear, and then they catch it. Easy.

Only issue: no idea which of the n Pokémon will appear, and where. It's totally (uniformly) random. You cannot even imagine the number of Magikarps 🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟 they already got... bad luck.

2/

So here's the first question you can help Ash and Barry with, so that at least they get a sense of how long they'll be in for and how many Pokéballs ⚾ this is going to cost.

How many Pokémons should they expect to have to capture until they have at least one of each?

Turns out, Barry really, really, really likes Jigglypuff. (Don't we all? So round! So sleep-inducing!)

And so he'd like to know how many Jigglypuffs he can hope to have, once all is said and done. The more, the jigglypuffier!

How many Jigglypuffs can Barry expect to have caught, once they have caught each Pokémon at least once?

    1️⃣ Θ(n)
    2️⃣ Θ(√n)
    3️⃣ Θ(log n)
    4️⃣ Θ(1)

In case this wasn't clear, this is Jigglypuff [GIF of Jigglypuff]. I hope you understand Barry, now.

Anyways, back to Ash!

5/

You see, Ash is a little worried about having too many Pokémon of a single type. It's not great to deplete the stocks of, say, Bulbasaurs, by capturing them all, and Ash wouldn't want to have legal issues because he has every single living Doduo 🦤 in his backpack... is there a risk?

6/

Once they have at least one of each, what's the expected MAXIMUM number of Pokémon of a single type Ash and Barry will have?

    1️⃣ Θ(n)
    2️⃣ Θ(log n/log log n)
    3️⃣ Θ(log n)
    4️⃣ Θ(1)

Last question! Barry is more worried about their Pokémon friends feeling lonely. Pokémon like to go at least by pairs of the same type and will feel sad if they're alone, single of a kind. "It's Mewtwo, after all, not Mew-one!"🫂

Is it likely to happen to many of them?

7/

Once Ash and Barry have at least one of each kind, what's the expected number of Pokémon who will be "single" (the only one of their kind)?

1️⃣ Θ(1)
2️⃣ Θ(n)
3️⃣ Θ(log n)
4️⃣ Θ(√n)
