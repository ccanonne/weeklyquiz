# Quiz 2: Carol and Dave have a random fight

_See the [Quiz on BlueSky]()._

## Backstory

 🧩 📊 Carol and Dave are in a pickle. They are scheduled to TA a class on randomized algorithms in a few minutes, and they did not have time to watch the lecture beforehand! Even worse, they never took the class before....

They don't even agree on what a randomized algo is! 
> A randomized algorithm is an algo which, on the same input, will...
> 1. give sometimes different answers
> 1. have sometimes a different runtime
> 1. Both
> 1. Neither?

Fine. They figured it out, just in the nick of time! But that's only the beginning... now, they have to figure out the answers to the students, who seem to have a pretty bad gambling addiction? They're asking what a _Las Vegas algorithm_ 🎰 is...
> A Las Vegas algorithm is...
> 1. ... always correct, but with a random runtime
> 1. ... sometimes wrong, but with a fixed runtime
> 1. ... something that happens and stays in Vegas 🎰
> 1. ... sometimes correct, and with random runtime

Now, Monte Carlo algorithms? They got it. These are easy: "you look at what a Las Vegas algo is, and it's the opposite." 🧐

Carole and Dave are relieved. The students, not so much. So they keep asking questions!

(A Monte Carlo algorithm has a fixed runtime, but can err with small probability.)


Well, the class is almost over, Carole and Dave are nearly off the hook... Just a few more minutes, nothing wrong can happen now...

"Can we always convert a Las Vegas algorithm into a Monte Carlo one, and vice-versa?"

Uhoh. 🥒
> 1. ... Las Vegas to Monte Carlo, yes! 🎲
> 1. ... Monte Carlo to Las Vegas, yes! 🪙
> 1. ... Both! 🎰
> 1. ... Neither! 💸
